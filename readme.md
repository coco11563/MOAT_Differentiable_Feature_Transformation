## Tools for evaluate the MOAT

We construct the generated optimal feature space from MOAT and 
provide a simple python script, named 'test_dataset.py', for 
reviewers to test the model performance.

Each HDF file contains three split: 

- 'test' is the test split of the original dataset.
- 'train' is the train split of the original dataset which aims to construct feature transformation records.
- 'data' is the transformed feature space (from test split) generated by MOAT

for evaluate the model performance, you can simply run :

```
python test_dataset.py --dataset dataset_name
```
